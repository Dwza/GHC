# Great Hall Calculator
This tool is to calculate your great hall.

It will show you how many tokes you need to finish the greate hall and how many runs you need depending on what arena 
stage you are in.

When you run GHC the first time, it will create a yaml file in the same folder where you executed it. Every change will 
be immediately saved to this file. On start it will check if any file exist and if so it will load it.

You can download the [latest version under Releases](https://github.com/Dwza/GHC/releases)

If you think there could be improvements, or there some bugs or what ever... open an issue.
